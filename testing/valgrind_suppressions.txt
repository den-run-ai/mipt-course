# There are three kinds of suppressions in this file:
# 1. Third party stuff we have no control over.
#
# 2. Intentional unit test errors, stuff that is somehow a false positive
# in our own code, or stuff that is so trivial it's not worth fixing.
#
# 3. Suppressions for real bugs that are not yet fixed.
# These should all be in our bug tracking system, please put a link to the
# bug issue into each suppression.
# Periodically we should sweep this file and the bug tracker clean by
# running overnight and removing outdated bugs/suppressions.
